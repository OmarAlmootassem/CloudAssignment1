# European Football Fan Experience

This is a single page web application built using NodeJS. The framework used for this application is AngularJS. The map in the background as well as the interactions with the map are provided through Google Maps Web API V3. The team and league information is coming from football-data.com RESTful API.

Image upload and tracking is handled by Firebase. Firebase is a backend as a service. I used the NoSQL database and the storage service to handle image uploading. When the image is uploaded through the application, a unique Id is generated by the client and then the picture is uploaded into Firebase Storage and then a reference is set up in the NoSQL database to the image so it can be easily retrieved.

For the visuals on the web app, I used Angular Material. Angular Material is a library provided by Google to give website the material design look that is used in Android phones since Lollipop got released a few years ago.

I used an Angular Seed so I do not have to build the entire architecture from scratch. The seed is available on GitHub: https://github.com/angular/angular-seed. For the animations, I used animate.css which is available from https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/.
